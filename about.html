      <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
      <p class="about">The purpose of this site is to showcase my web development skills and as a start for a larger site where I can host my projects. If you'd like to see what I am working on check out the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>. On there I have my github and linkedin linked for your convenience. I am also keeping track of what I would like to host on this site, if you'd like to see that check out the <a href="todo.html">todo page</a>.</p>
