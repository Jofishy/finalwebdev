          <p id="hidden2" class="hidden">In my free time I enjoy creating games, and many of them are written in javascript/html and can be hosted on a site. When I have one of these games completed I would like to create a site where I can host them to be consumed.</p>

          <p id="list-head3">Video streaming site</p>
          <p id="hidden3" class="hidden">I have some ideas for creating a unique streaming site. The licensing for movies is expensive and almost impossible to set up as a startup unless you have a lot of capital, so I may be sitting on this idea for a while.</p>
